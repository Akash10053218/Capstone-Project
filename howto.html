        <h3>Join or Create a Room</h3>
        <p>Start by joining an existing game room or create your own. You can invite friends using a room code or join
          public matches. Wait for enough players to join before the game begins (typically 4-10 players).</p>

        <h3>Receive Your Secret Role</h3>
        <p>Once the game starts, you'll be randomly assigned a role: Survivor, Saboteur, or Detective. Your role is
          secret
          - only you know what you are. Your objectives depend on your role, so pay attention to the instructions.</p>

        <h3>Complete Tasks or Sabotage</h3>
        <p>If you're a Survivor or Detective, complete tasks around the map to progress the mission. If you're a
          Saboteur,
          sabotage systems, eliminate players, and prevent task completion. Use your abilities wisely and avoid
          suspicion.

        <h3>Report and Discuss</h3>
        <p>When a body is found or a sabotage occurs, an emergency meeting is called. Use this time to discuss what
          happened, share information, and try to identify the Saboteurs. Be convincing in your defense or accusations.

        <h3>Vote Out Suspicious Players</h3>
        <p>After discussion, vote to eliminate the most suspicious player. If you're a Saboteur, try to frame innocent
          players. If you're a Survivor, work together to identify the threats. The player with the most votes is
          eliminated.</p>

        <h3>Survive Till the End</h3>
        <p>The game continues until one team achieves their win condition. Survivors win by completing all tasks or
          eliminating all Saboteurs. Saboteurs win by equalizing numbers or preventing task completion. Play
          strategically
          and adapt to the situation!</p>

      <h2>Pro Tips</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Watch Behavior:</strong> Pay attention to how players move and act - Saboteurs often behave
          differently</li>
        <li><strong>Use Alibis:</strong> Always have a story ready about where you were and what you were doing</li>
        <li><strong>Stick Together:</strong> Survivors should travel in groups to avoid being eliminated</li>
        <li><strong>Blend In:</strong> Saboteurs should act like Survivors and complete fake tasks to avoid suspicion
        </li>
        <li><strong>Take Notes:</strong> Remember who was where and when - information is your best weapon</li>
        <li><strong>Trust No One:</strong> Even if someone seems trustworthy, they might be deceiving you</li>
